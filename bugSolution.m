The solution involves careful handling of `self` and using appropriate techniques for delayed execution:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // Correct: Assign to myString after self is fully initialized by [super init].
        self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
        // ...further initialization...
    }
    return self;
}
@end

//For performSelector issues: Consider using blocks or other timer mechanisms that are tied to the object's lifecycle.
// Example using GCD timer to avoid deallocation issue.

- (void)doSomethingAfterDelay:(NSTimeInterval)delay {
    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(delay * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        if (self) { // Check if self is still valid
            // Your code here
        }
    });
}
```
By ensuring `self` is properly initialized before accessing its properties and carefully managing the lifetime of objects when using delayed selectors, these issues can be avoided.
