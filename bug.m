In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves incorrect usage of `self` within methods, particularly during initialization.  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // Incorrect: Assigning to myString before self is fully initialized.
        self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"]; 
        // ...further initialization...
    }
    return self;
}
@end
```

The problem is that `self` might not be fully initialized before assigning to `myString`.  If `[super init]` fails, `self` would be `nil`, and assigning to `myString` in this state could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This is more likely to happen if you have overridden `-init` and forget to always call `[super init]` first, or if you're not handling potential errors in custom initializers.

Another lesser-known issue occurs when using `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` or similar methods. If the object on which the selector is being performed is deallocated before the delay expires, a crash or unexpected behavior might result. Proper memory management and ensuring the target object's lifetime exceeds the delay are crucial.
